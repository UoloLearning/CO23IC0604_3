      <div class="myDiv">
          <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy around 13.6 billion years old with large pivoting arms stretching out across the cosmos. Just as Earth orbits the sun, the solar system orbits the centre of the Milky Way. Despite hurtling through space at speeds of around 515,000mph (828,000kmph) our solar system takes approximately 250 million years to complete a single revolution.
